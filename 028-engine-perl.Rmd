# https://support.rstudio.com/hc/communities/public/questions/202705076-R-Markdown-File-Not-Knitting-Since-Recent-RStudio-Update
library(knitr) # added to see if it helps - and it did!

Sys.which('perl')
```

Does `perl` work?

```{r test-perl, engine='perl', comment=NA}
$test = "jello world";
$test =~ s/j/h/;
print $test
```
